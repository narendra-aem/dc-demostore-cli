## ⚠️ Breaking change v4.0.0 (after v2.x) ⚠️
A breaking change was introduced _after_ version `v2.x` of this CLI which removed complex automation rules. In order for your demostore to work, you need the following:

1) Automation should use latest automation from [dc-demostore-automation](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-automation)
2) Latest version of the dc-demostore-core FE from [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core)

### Recommended Upgrade path
This path assumes that you already have an Amplience Dynamic Content account with content and a deployed URL in Vercel.
For search related features such as blog, dynamic blog list, search box, you will also need your own Algolia API details:
- Algolia Application ID
- Algolia Search Key
- Algolia Write Key

1) Get latest version of dc-demostore-cli from npm

  `npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli` or if you installed globally `npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli -g`

Once updated you can validate you are on the latest version by running the following command and checking that it matches the latest release on this github page:

```
demostore --version
```

2) Update your environment configuration with Algolia details. If you don't provide these, the Blog page will use Filter API instead of Algolia.
You will need to remove your hub configuration before adding them again, so you might want to save them before from you `.amplience/environments.json` file.

  `demostore env delete [env]`

  `demostore env add`

When asked, you can add your Algolia API details.

2) Clean your Amplience Dynamic Content account to start from a blank canvas

  `demostore cleanup -c -a`

3) Import from latest automation set

  `demostore import -l`

  See [import](../README.md#import) for details needed to update your front end

4) Update your front end [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core) to the latest version and deploy using the right environment variables

### Staying on an older version
Deployed versions will continue to work if you are not changing anything.
